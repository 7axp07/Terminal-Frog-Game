## "Frogger"-inspired terminal game, written in C with the use of the ncurses library.

*Code is not very clean due to limitations set for the project (eg. no global variables, set max. function lengths etc. ~~So my deepest apologies for how unclean the code is~~).*

-----------------------------------

### Compile and run:
`gcc FrogGame.c -o frogger -lncurses`

`./frogger`
